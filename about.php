<h3>What is Artmoney?</h3>

<p>The basic idea of artmoney is, that artists produce a hand-made currency at a fixed value that can be spend at regular shops.<br><br>

The concept of exchanging art for goods and services is as old as humankind and the value of art is recognized by all people. Artmoney simply introduces a system that unites format and value to make exchange easy, fun and beautiful.<br><br>

Artmoney holds the format 12x18 cm and the value of Danish Kroner 200. This applies to all artists at all social and professional levels from all countries. When it comes to artmoney, all people are worth the same.<br><br>
Artists make their own money.<br>
Companies accept artmoney as payment.<br>
Collectors buy artmoney as inexpensive, original art.<br><br>

Check the value of artmoney in your local currency (Danish Kroner 200) with <a href="https://finance.google.com/finance/converter">CURRENCY CONVERTER.</a>

<h3>The history of Artmoney</h3>
<p>It all began in December 1997 when I painted the first artmoney. The idea was clear from the beginning. I wanted to create a "personal currency" that would enable me to draw my own money and free me from economic slavery. What I had not dared to hope then, was that artmoney could become a currency for people worldwide.<br><br>
From the start I had luck with using artmoney in stores. I also found that the small works of art were easy to exchange (sell) into “ordinary” money if I needed it.<br><br>
In 1998, artist, Flemming Vincent, joined the project. We founded the "Bank of International Artmoney" (BIAM) and made the first web site, so artists from near and far to join the "bank." The Internet had just become available to the general public, and it seemed natural to put the project out to the world community so everyone could make their own money.<br><br>
In 2001, I traveled half a year on a motorcycle through North America and paid the trip with artmoney, I painted along the way. The trip demonstrated artmoney as an excellent travel currency! Jesper Jargil film began shooting a documentary about the project.<br><br>
In 2003, BIAM has grown to more than 100 artists from Denmark, the United States and Canada. We were invited to exhibit in the 5000 square meter showroom “Oeksnehallen,” downtown, Copenhagen. The exhibition was opened by former CEO of the National Bank of Denmark, Erik Hoffmeyer. It received massive press coverage and set record attendance despite a historic snowfall.<br><br>
Oeksnehallen was the beginning of a true adventure.<br><br>
With the help of Peter Rodenberg from InleadMedia, the project created a new site that could sell the artists artmoney online. BIAM was registered as a company. We got busy and Vincent resigned from the board to devote his time to his own art. Soon the auction house, “Lauritz.com,” bought 49% of BIAM by paying for the development of yet another new site.<br><br>
In 2005, I was charged by the “National Financial Advisory Board” for the illegal use of the word "bank." The penalty was up to four months in prison. After a long trial I got off with a fine of Danish Kroner 2000 and lost the right to the use of the word “Bank.” There was no law forbidding us to paint our own money, so we continued doing that. The court case received much media attention, which meant that many new artists joined. Soon BIAM reached 1000 members.<br><br>
In 2012 Lauritz.com pulled out of BIAM, since we did not share the same views on the purpose of artmoney.<br><br>
In 2014 “Korpus Design” developed a new site where artists could upload their own artmoney and sell them directly from home without commission. Simultaneously, shops and collectors became able to sell artmoney online, and the movement of the alternative currency had reached a complete cyclus.
Between the lines the story of artmoney holds thousands of adventures experienced by the many people involved. And the story continues...</p>

<h3>The vision</h3>

<p>Artmoney is a tool for investigating the nature of human value. The method is to study, evaluate, conclude, act, reflect, and study again. It is an ongoing cycle that evolves as a wheel of transformation. The artmoney community itself is an ever-changing organism. We hope that artmoney can contribute to the discovery of beauty in general and individual purpose in specific.<br><br>

Artmoney is a “down to earth art project” driven by concrete results and utopian visions.<br><br>

Artmoney is based on a decentralized management in regards to action and relies on chaos as a source of inspiration. Each artmoney artist is regarded a "bank manager" who has a mandate to shape the evolution by their own dreams and actions. The artmoney head office simply holds the strings of change in a central portal and channel incoming influences by displaying some of the visual results on this site for all to view. Many more artmoney circulate around the world as physical art objects in search of appreciation and understanding. Artmoney reflects the body of a collective human effort and may as such be considered as "soft cash."<br><br>

Your vision for artmoney may be completely different from mine. Artmoney represents as many visions as there are artmoney artists. My vision is to realize some of the utopian dreams born out of art:</p>

<ul  style="list-style-type:square">
<li>Freedom from economic slavery to live the life we wish for</li>

<li>A global network of shops that accepts artmoney</li>

<li>A hand made currency that offers poor people the opportunity to paint their money on the spot and buy stuff</li>

<li>To slow down time</li>

<li>To steal the attention away from war and corruption and embrace beauty instead of greed
To level with each other in spite of differences in status, culture, religion, or political standpoint

<li>To see and share and learn</li>

<li>To introduce function to art and art to living</li></ul>
